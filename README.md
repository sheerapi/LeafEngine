## FAQ
### When i try to play an .mp3 file it doesn't play
This is a extract from the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org) docs.
> SFML supports the audio file formats WAV, OGG/Vorbis and FLAC. Due to licensing issues MP3 is **not supported**.
### Will this have an editor?
Yes, it's planned, but first, every bug needs to be solved, but dw, im working on it :)
